								<blockquote>The overall state of general practice [in England] is bad and still deteriorating.</blockquote>
								<cite><b>Collings JS</b> (1950), ‘General practice in England today: a reconnaissance’ <i><a target="_blank" href="http://www.lancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(50)90462-4/fulltext">The Lancet</a></i> i, 555–85.</cite>
								<p>JS Collings, an Australian research fellow at the Harvard University School of Public Health, is commissioned by the Nuffield Trust to undertake a survey of general practice in England.</p>
								<p>His report, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(50)90462-4/fulltext">published in <i>The Lancet</i></a>, is damning. He finds that: “the overall state of general practice is bad and still deteriorating”; “some [working conditions] are bad enough to require condemnation in the public interest”; and inner-city practice is “at best... very unsatisfactory and at worst a positive source of public danger”.</p> 
								<p>His report is followed by further studies; leading ultimately to the foundation of the College of General Practitioners in 1952; and slowly, more government action to assist the development of general practice. </p>

								<p>The uneven distribution of primary care services was a key problem at the formation of the NHS and successive surveys demonstrated that many areas were ‘under doctored’.</p>
								<p>In 1950, the Ministry of Health commissions Sir Henry Cohen to undertake a wide-ranging review of general practice. This leads to the provision of interest-free loans (backed by the Treasury) to help GPs develop their practice premises as well as mechanisms to control the geographical distribution of GPs.</p>

								<p>In 1950, a committee headed by Alderman Bradbeer is appointed by the Central Health Services Council (advisors to the Ministry of Health) to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/sites/files/nuffield/publication/The_NHS_a_Managers_Tale.pdf">examine hospital administration arrangements in the English NHS [pdf]</a>.</p>
								<p>The resulting guidance is supportive of the system typical in voluntary hospitals (which avoids the hierarchy of local authority hospitals). It draws on the former’s concept of a ‘tripartite administration’ of medical, nursing and lay elements, but with the lay element (in the person of the group secretary) given overall responsibility for implementing policy and coordinating the activities of the group.</p>

								<p>In February 1953, the Treasury requests an inquiry into the NHS and related expenditure, and the Guillebaud Committee is set up.  The emphasis of the subsequent report is intended to be on preventing further increases in expenditure, rather than introducing cuts. </p>
								<p>However, the <a target="_blank" href="http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1956/jan/25/national-health-service-guillebaud-report">Guillebaud Report of 1955</a> finds that: in relative terms, NHS spending had fallen between 1948 and 1954, from 3.75 per cent to 3.25 per cent of Gross National Product; that capital spending was running at only 33 per cent of pre-war levels; and that additional costs implied by an ageing population could be financed easily by economic growth.</p>
								<p>Nevertheless, the Government continues to seek economies.</p>

								<p>In response to the growing number of specialist registrars unable to secure consultant posts, a committee is set up under Henry Willink to examine the supply of medical professionals. </p>
								<p>The committee concludes that too many doctors are being trained and proposes a 12 per cent reduction. This is soon realised to be a misjudgement and in 1961 the Minister of Health is forced to increase the number of training places by 10 per cent.</p>

								<cite>Percy Commission (1957), quoted on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mentalhealth.freeuk.com/relation.htm">Mental Health Policy</a></cite>
								<p>In 1954, a Royal Commission, chaired by Lord Percy, is instructed to enquire into “the existing law and administrative machinery governing the certification, detention, care... absence on trial, or licence, discharge and supervision of persons who are or allege to be suffering from mental illness or mental defect” (Royal Commission terms of reference).</p>
								<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2788.1957.tb00008.x/abstract">Commission’s report</a>, published in 1957, calls for the abolition of special legal formalities connected with mental illness and mental deficiency; the absorption of mental health in the general administration of the NHS; and the extension of local authorities’ powers and duties (Jones K, 1972, <i>A history of the mental health services</i>. Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, p.306).</p>

						<p>The Mental Health Act replaces much of the existing legislation on the provision of mental health services in England, bringing the provision of mental health services within the general administrative machinery of the NHS for the first time.</p>

								<header><h2><span class="yyyy">1959</span><span class="mmmm">July</span></h2></header>

								<p>Building on the conclusions of the Percy Commission, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/7-8/72/introduction">Mental Health Act</a> 1959 enshrines two principles in law: the provision of as much treatment as possible on a voluntary and informal basis; and a new system of safeguards in cases where compulsion is necessary (Jones K, 1972, <i>A history of the mental health services</i>. Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, p.307).</p> 
								<p>In so doing, the Act also oversees the closure of large psychiatric hospitals in favour of community-based services. </p>
