								<p>In the light of the Prime Minister’s commitment, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, asks Sir Derek Wanless, a banker, to <a target="_blank" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http:/www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/consult_wanless_final.htm">review the long-term funding needs of the NHS.</a></p>
								<p>Published in April 2002, his report suggests that future funding needs will depend on the extent to which future demand for health care is reduced by good public health policies and by disease prevention. </p>

								<p>The document outlines plans to: better engage local clinicians in the design of services; roll-out practice-based commissioning universally and to a faster timetable; develop primary care trusts (PCTs) to support practice-based commissioning; and to review the functions of strategic health authorities (SHAs) to support commissioning and contract management. </p>
								<p>The document instructs PCTs to “make arrangements for 100 per cent coverage of practice-based commissioning by no later than the end of 2006”, although individual practices are given some flexibility to take on commissioning to a greater or lesser extent depending on their wishes and capabilities. </p>
								<p>All budgets are set to be ‘indicative’ only, with PCTs continuing to hold the actual funds.</p>

His resulting report, <i><a target="_blank" href="http://www.london.nhs.uk/webfiles/board/07%20meeting%2008%20Aug/Enc%20B%20HfL-NHSL%20Board%20paper.pdf">Healthcare for London: A framework for action [pdf]</a></i>, sets out how London’s health care needs to change over the following 10 years. </p>
								<p>The underlying emphasis is on moving the provision of routine health care closer to people’s homes and centralising specialist care services. Specific recommendations include the development of academic health science centres and the introduction of polyclinics – a term used to describe large community facilities that will provide a much wider range of services than is offered by most GP practices, such as minor procedures, urgent care and x-rays.</p>

								<p>Professor Sir (soon to become Lord) Darzi joins the Government as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department of Health and is tasked with leading a major review of the NHS to outline a 10-year vision for its future. A <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_085828.pdf">series of reports appears[pdf]</a>, with many clinically driven and defining good practice. </p>
								<p>Lord Darzi’s vision includes major reconfiguration of hospital services, driven by quality and the clinical realities of where care is best delivered. Centralising specialist services is a major theme, while polyclinics (large community facilities providing a much wider range of services than is offered by most GP practices) are proposed.</p>

This includes treating patients with dignity and respect and enabling informed choice.</p>

								<p>The CQC, a new independent regulator of all health and social care services in England, is created following the merger of three regulators: the Healthcare Commission, the Commission for Social Care Inspection and the Mental Health Act Commission. </p>
								<p>The CQC takes on responsibility for regulating and inspecting health and social care services in England, including services provided by the NHS, local authorities, private companies and voluntary organisations. The CQC’s remit extends to protecting people whose rights are restricted under the Mental Health Act.</p>

								<p>Sir David Nicholson, writing in his <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_099689">2008/09 annual report</a>, sets the scene for future efficiency savings by warning the NHS to plan “on the assumption that we will need to release unprecedented levels of efficiency savings between 2011 and 2014 – between £15 billion and £20 billion across the service over the three years”. This figure is widely cited in subsequent debates and discussions.</p>
