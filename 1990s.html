								<p>The <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/19/contents">NHS and Community Care Act 1990</a> creates an internal market and a purchaser-provider split in which the purchasers (mainly health authorities) are handed budgets to purchase services from providers (mainly acute hospitals and those providing care for people with mental health problems, people with learning disabilities as well as older people). </p>
								<p>One of the most significant reforms is to establish ‘GP fund-holding’, which enables GPs to take on budgets and purchase services from hospitals and other providers on behalf of their patients. </p>
								<p>Not all GPs become fundholders, with non-fundholders having their services purchased for them by local health authorities. Critics accuse the Government of creating a two-tier system in which patients of GP fundholders are able to access treatment more quickly than those belonging to non-fundholding GPs. Supporters of the policy claim that fundholding helps to deliver more efficient care. </p>
