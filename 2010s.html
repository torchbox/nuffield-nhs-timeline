								<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_117353">White Paper</a> reveals the Coalition Government’s plans for reforming the NHS in England. </p>
								<p>The proposals, resembling ideas trailed while the Conservative Party was in opposition, outline a number of key reforms, including: giving groups of GP practices ‘real’ budgets to buy care; abolishing all primary care trusts (PCTs) and strategic health authorities (SHAs), and creating a new NHS Commissioning Board; scrapping performance targets, including waiting times; and transforming <a target="_blank" href="http://www.monitor-nhsft.gov.uk/">Monitor</a> into an economic regulator. </p>
								<p>The centre-piece of the proposals entails shifting responsibility for purchasing care to groups of GPs, who through their work referring patients are felt to be in a better position to identify efficiencies and demand quality from providers. </p>
								<p>Concerns are muted at the scale and pace of the plans, with critics claiming that the changes would distract the NHS from achieving the £20 billion in productivity savings it has committed to achieving up to 2015.</p>

						<p><b>NHS reorganisation</b>: The Health and Social Care Bill 2010/11 proposes significant reforms to increase the influence of GPs on commissioning, increase competition and abolish strategic health authorities (SHAs) and primary care trusts (PCTs).</p>

								<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmbills/132/11132.i-v.html">Health and Social Care Bill 2010/11</a> is introduced into Parliament on 19 January 2011. </p>
								<p>It envisages a bottom-up, clinically owned network of GP commissioning groups with ‘real’ budgets to buy care on behalf of their local communities; shifting many of the responsibilities historically located in the Department of Health to a new, politically independent NHS Commissioning Board; creating a health-specific economic regulator (Monitor) with a mandate to guard against ‘anti-competitive’ practices; and moving all NHS trusts to autonomous foundation trust status. </p>
								<p>SHAs and PCTs are to be abolished, while integration between NHS and local authority services is to be strengthened through new health and wellbeing boards. The voice of patients is to be empowered through the establishment of a new national body, Health Watch, and local Health Watch organisations. Public Health England, a new body, is to the lead on public health at the national level, with local authorities taking the lead locally.</p>
								<p>Meanwhile, the landscape of health care provision is to be galvanised by a dose of competitively driven innovation, with an expectation of easier entry and exit to the market for a range of private and voluntary sector providers.</p>

								<p>Several key measures are announced in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/07/careandsupportwhitepaper/">Care and Support White Paper</a>, together with the draft <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/07/careandsupportbill/">Care and Support Bill</a>, including: access to care to be consistent through a national threshold for basic care and people to not have their care interrupted if they move around the country; carers to have new rights to public support; greater national consistency in access to care and support to be introduced; and integration of different services to be improved.</p>
								<p>An <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/07/scfunding/">accompanying ‘progress report’</a> on funding, outlines the Government’s support for the principles of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dilnotcommission.dh.gov.uk/our-report/">Dilnot Commission’s model</a>, therefore financial protection through capped costs and an extended means test would be the basis for any new funding model. </p>
								<p>Alongside this, the Government commits to introducing a Universal Deferred Payments scheme to ensure no-one will be forced to sell their home to pay for care in their lifetime. However, the Government does not commit to introducing a new system at this stage, with decisions on funding reform put back until the next Spending Review when a “final decision will be taken”.</p>

<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.midstaffspublicinquiry.com/report">final report</a>, published on Wednesday 6 February 2013, addresses a range of issues of concern to NHS managers, clinical staff and patients, including: the recruitment, training and competency of staff; the regulation of care services; the science of quality measurement; the role of public voice and oversight; and the degree to which those working in the NHS feel empowered and engaged.</p>
<p>Set up in 2010 by the coalition Government, the Public Inquiry looked to build on a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.midstaffsinquiry.com/">previous inquiry in 2008</a>, also chaired by Robert Francis QC, which looked at individual cases of patient care.</p>
<p>Nuffield Trust <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/about/our-people/dr-judith-smith">Director of Policy Dr Judith Smith</a> acted as an assessor to the Public Inquiry. Responding to the publication of the final report in February 2013, Dr Smith said: "We must not ignore the central implication of this report – namely, that within parts of the NHS dignity, care and compassion are routinely absent from the care of patients. The temptation may otherwise be to convince ourselves that the key lessons have already been learnt and improvements made."</p><p>Read more about the Trust’s work to support the Inquiry on our <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/our-work/projects/francis-inquiry">dedicated project page</a>.</p><p>Image credit: <a target="_blank" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hospital_room1.tiff">Wikimedia Commons</a>, 2012 © CDC.</p>

								<p>Primary care trusts (PCTs) are abolished. Their functions pass to <a target="_blank" href=" http://www.england.nhs.uk/">NHS England</a> (previously known as the NHS Commissioning Board) and the 211 clinical commissioning groups (CCGS) it has authorised.</p>
<p>CCGs which are only partially authorised are subject to special conditions from NHS England as they take on their new role. Some remain unauthorised, staying in ‘shadow’ form while NHS England takes on commissioning directly. CCGs will be supported by a number of commissioning support units (CSUs), which will provide a range of business functions designed to help CCGs improve services. </p>
<p>Strategic health authorities (SHAs) are also abolished. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hee.nhs.uk/">Health Education England</a> takes on SHAs’ responsibility for education, training and workforce development.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ntda.nhs.uk/">NHS Trust Development Authority</a> takes on responsibility for providing governance and accountability for NHS trusts and for delivering the foundation trust pipeline.</p>
<p>Four regional and 27 local branches of NHS England take on responsibility for the strategic oversight of provision and commissioning in their areas. Public health responsibilities are transferred to local authorities. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england">Public Health England</a> is established to improve the nation’s health and wellbeing and reduce inequalities.</p>
<p>New health and wellbeing boards are established. An independent consumer champion – <a target="_blank" href=" http://www.healthwatch.co.uk/">Healthwatch England</a> – is also created.</p>
