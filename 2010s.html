								<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_117353">White Paper</a> reveals the Coalition Government’s plans for reforming the NHS in England. </p>
								<p>The proposals, resembling ideas trailed while the Conservative Party was in opposition, outline a number of key reforms, including: giving groups of GP practices ‘real’ budgets to buy care; abolishing all primary care trusts (PCTs) and strategic health authorities (SHAs), and creating a new NHS Commissioning Board; scrapping performance targets, including waiting times; and transforming <a target="_blank" href="http://www.monitor-nhsft.gov.uk/">Monitor</a> into an economic regulator. </p>
								<p>The centre-piece of the proposals entails shifting responsibility for purchasing care to groups of GPs, who through their work referring patients are felt to be in a better position to identify efficiencies and demand quality from providers. </p>
								<p>Concerns are muted at the scale and pace of the plans, with critics claiming that the changes would distract the NHS from achieving the £20 billion in productivity savings it has committed to achieving up to 2015.</p>

						<p><b>NHS reorganisation</b>: The Health and Social Care Bill 2010/11 proposes significant reforms to increase the influence of GPs on commissioning, increase competition and abolish strategic health authorities (SHAs) and primary care trusts (PCTs).</p>

								<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmbills/132/11132.i-v.html">Health and Social Care Bill 2010/11</a> is introduced into Parliament on 19 January 2011. </p>
								<p>It envisages a bottom-up, clinically owned network of GP commissioning groups with ‘real’ budgets to buy care on behalf of their local communities; shifting many of the responsibilities historically located in the Department of Health to a new, politically independent NHS Commissioning Board; creating a health-specific economic regulator (Monitor) with a mandate to guard against ‘anti-competitive’ practices; and moving all NHS trusts to autonomous foundation trust status. </p>
								<p>SHAs and PCTs are to be abolished, while integration between NHS and local authority services is to be strengthened through new health and wellbeing boards. The voice of patients is to be empowered through the establishment of a new national body, Health Watch, and local Health Watch organisations. Public Health England, a new body, is to the lead on public health at the national level, with local authorities taking the lead locally.</p>
								<p>Meanwhile, the landscape of health care provision is to be galvanised by a dose of competitively driven innovation, with an expectation of easier entry and exit to the market for a range of private and voluntary sector providers.</p>

								<p>Several key measures are announced in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/07/careandsupportwhitepaper/">Care and Support White Paper</a>, together with the draft <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/07/careandsupportbill/">Care and Support Bill</a>, including: access to care to be consistent through a national threshold for basic care and people to not have their care interrupted if they move around the country; carers to have new rights to public support; greater national consistency in access to care and support to be introduced; and integration of different services to be improved.</p>
								<p>An <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/07/scfunding/">accompanying ‘progress report’</a> on funding, outlines the Government’s support for the principles of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dilnotcommission.dh.gov.uk/our-report/">Dilnot Commission’s model</a>, therefore financial protection through capped costs and an extended means test would be the basis for any new funding model. </p>
								<p>Alongside this, the Government commits to introducing a Universal Deferred Payments scheme to ensure no-one will be forced to sell their home to pay for care in their lifetime. However, the Government does not commit to introducing a new system at this stage, with decisions on funding reform put back until the next Spending Review when a “final decision will be taken”.</p>

<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.midstaffspublicinquiry.com/report">final report</a>, published on Wednesday 6 February 2013, addresses a range of issues of concern to NHS managers, clinical staff and patients, including: the recruitment, training and competency of staff; the regulation of care services; the science of quality measurement; the role of public voice and oversight; and the degree to which those working in the NHS feel empowered and engaged.</p>
<p>Set up in 2010 by the coalition Government, the Public Inquiry looked to build on a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.midstaffsinquiry.com/">previous inquiry in 2008</a>, also chaired by Robert Francis QC, which looked at individual cases of patient care.</p>
<p>Nuffield Trust <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/about/our-people/dr-judith-smith">Director of Policy Dr Judith Smith</a> acted as an assessor to the Public Inquiry. Responding to the publication of the final report in February 2013, Dr Smith said: "We must not ignore the central implication of this report – namely, that within parts of the NHS dignity, care and compassion are routinely absent from the care of patients. The temptation may otherwise be to convince ourselves that the key lessons have already been learnt and improvements made."</p><p>In February 2014, the Nuffield Trust <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/publications/francis-inquiry-one-year-on">published a report</a> exploring the impact of the Francis Report after one year. The research found that financial pressures and a complex regulatory environment are making it difficult for hospitals to create the kind of patient-centred culture recommended in the report.</p></p><p>Read more about the Trust’s work to support the Inquiry on our <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/our-work/projects/francis-inquiry">dedicated project page</a>.</p><p>Image credit: <a target="_blank" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hospital_room1.tiff">Wikimedia Commons</a>, 2012 © CDC.</p>

								<p>Primary care trusts (PCTs) are abolished. Their functions pass to <a target="_blank" href=" http://www.england.nhs.uk/">NHS England</a> (previously known as the NHS Commissioning Board) and the 211 clinical commissioning groups (CCGS) it has authorised.</p>
<p>CCGs which are only partially authorised are subject to special conditions from NHS England as they take on their new role. Some remain unauthorised, staying in ‘shadow’ form while NHS England takes on commissioning directly. CCGs will be supported by a number of commissioning support units (CSUs), which will provide a range of business functions designed to help CCGs improve services. </p>
<p>Strategic health authorities (SHAs) are also abolished. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hee.nhs.uk/">Health Education England</a> takes on SHAs’ responsibility for education, training and workforce development.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ntda.nhs.uk/">NHS Trust Development Authority</a> takes on responsibility for providing governance and accountability for NHS trusts and for delivering the foundation trust pipeline.</p>
<p>Four regional and 27 local branches of NHS England take on responsibility for the strategic oversight of provision and commissioning in their areas. Public health responsibilities are transferred to local authorities. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england">Public Health England</a> is established to improve the nation’s health and wellbeing and reduce inequalities.</p>

								<p>An <a href= https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pharmaceutical-price-regulation-scheme-2014>agreement</a> is established between the Department of Health and the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) was made in November 2013 on the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme.</p>
<p>This scheme would provide assurance on most of the branded medicine bills for the NHS, which would stay flat over the next two years and grow slowly after that. If NHS spending on branded medicines exceeds the allowed growth rate, then the pharmaceutical industry would make payments to the Department of Health. </p>

<p> The 1 April 2014 marked the first anniversary of the implementation of the Coalition Government’s NHS reforms; including this introduction of clinical commissioning groups (CCGs). To mark this milestone the Nuffield Trust and The King’s Fund conducted a survey of GPs from six CCGs exploring member engagement and primary care development one year on. 
The anniversary also marked Simon Stevens becoming the new Chief Executive of NHS England. </p>

								<p>For the first time, the partner organisations that deliver and oversee health and care services including NHS England, Public Health England, Monitor, Health Education England, the Care Quality Commission and the NHS Trust Development Authority set out a shared vision for the future of the NHS in England. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/futurenhs/">The Five Year Forward View</a> outlines how the NHS needs to change over the next five years if it is to reduce health inequalities, improve the quality of care and meet an estimated £30 billion gap in funding by 2020/21.</p>
<p>Advised by the <a target=“_blank” href=http://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/5-year-forward-view-response>Nuffield Trust</a> and other independent experts, the report outlines a number of options for how local health communities can create new ways of organising and delivering patient care. With no ‘one size fits all’ care model in mind, the report examines how groups of GPs may combine with nurses, other community health services, hospital specialists and mental health and social care to create integrated out-of-hospital care – so-called 'Multispecialty Community Providers'.</p>
<p>A further new option will be the integrated hospital and primary care provider – so-called 'Primary and Acute Care Systems', which would combine for the first time general practice and hospital services (in a similar way to the Accountable Care Organisations now developing in other countries).</p>

						<p> Autumn Statement injects £2billion into the NHS budget for 2015/16

								<p>On 3 December 2014, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, presented the annual <a target=“_blank” href=https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/autumn-statement-2014>Autumn Statement.</a></p>
<p>When the Coalition Government came to power in 2010, they agreed to ring-fence the health budget. In other words, for each year since 2010, the budget was only supposed to increase to account for inflation. While there have been some small increases to the health budget, it was just this year that George Osborne promised a large financial injection.</p>
<p>In this Autumn Statement, an extra £2billion to fund the NHS was promised. As Nuffield Trust analysis (see figure above) shows, part of that funding (£300million across the whole UK) was from money raised through bank fines for those who had fixed foreign exchange rates. About £1.3 billion is slated to come from elsewhere in government, while £700million is underspend that comes directly from the Department of Health budget.</p>
