								<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_117353">White Paper</a> reveals the Coalition Government’s plans for reforming the NHS in England. </p>
								<p>The proposals, resembling ideas trailed while the Conservative Party was in opposition, outline a number of key reforms, including: giving groups of GP practices ‘real’ budgets to buy care; abolishing all primary care trusts (PCTs) and strategic health authorities (SHAs), and creating a new NHS Commissioning Board; scrapping performance targets, including waiting times; and transforming <a target="_blank" href="http://www.monitor-nhsft.gov.uk/">Monitor</a> into an economic regulator. </p>
								<p>The centre-piece of the proposals entails shifting responsibility for purchasing care to groups of GPs, who through their work referring patients are felt to be in a better position to identify efficiencies and demand quality from providers. </p>
								<p>Concerns are muted at the scale and pace of the plans, with critics claiming that the changes would distract the NHS from achieving the £20 billion in productivity savings it has committed to achieving up to 2015.</p>

						<p><b>NHS reorganisation</b>: The Health and Social Care Bill 2010/11 proposes significant reforms to increase the influence of GPs on commissioning, increase competition and abolish strategic health authorities (SHAs) and primary care trusts (PCTs).</p>

								<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmbills/132/11132.i-v.html">Health and Social Care Bill 2010/11</a> is introduced into Parliament on 19 January 2011. </p>
								<p>It envisages a bottom-up, clinically owned network of GP commissioning groups with ‘real’ budgets to buy care on behalf of their local communities; shifting many of the responsibilities historically located in the Department of Health to a new, politically independent NHS Commissioning Board; creating a health-specific economic regulator (Monitor) with a mandate to guard against ‘anti-competitive’ practices; and moving all NHS trusts to autonomous foundation trust status. </p>
								<p>SHAs and PCTs are to be abolished, while integration between NHS and local authority services is to be strengthened through new health and wellbeing boards. The voice of patients is to be empowered through the establishment of a new national body, Health Watch, and local Health Watch organisations. Public Health England, a new body, is to the lead on public health at the national level, with local authorities taking the lead locally.</p>
								<p>Meanwhile, the landscape of health care provision is to be galvanised by a dose of competitively driven innovation, with an expectation of easier entry and exit to the market for a range of private and voluntary sector providers.</p>

								<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dilnotcommission.dh.gov.uk/our-report/">Commission for Funding of Care and Support</a>, chaired by economist Andrew Dilnot, is tasked with finding a way to create an affordable and sustainable funding system. </p>

								<p>Several key measures are announced in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/07/careandsupportwhitepaper/">Care and Support White Paper</a>, together with the draft <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/07/careandsupportbill/">Care and Support Bill</a>, including: access to care to be consistent through a national threshold for basic care and people to not have their care interrupted if they move around the country; carers to have new rights to public support; greater national consistency in access to care and support to be introduced; and integration of different services to be improved.</p>
								<p>An <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/07/scfunding/">accompanying ‘progress report’</a> on funding, outlines the Government’s support for the principles of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dilnotcommission.dh.gov.uk/our-report/">Dilnot Commission’s model</a>, therefore financial protection through capped costs and an extended means test would be the basis for any new funding model. </p>
								<p>Alongside this, the Government commits to introducing a Universal Deferred Payments scheme to ensure no-one will be forced to sell their home to pay for care in their lifetime. However, the Government does not commit to introducing a new system at this stage, with decisions on funding reform put back until the next Spending Review when a “final decision will be taken”.</p>

								<p>The new arrangements heralded by the Health and Social Care Act 2012 will come into being from 1 April 2013.</p> 
								<p>Strategic health authorities and primary care trusts (PCTs) will be formally abolished. Responsibility for commissioning most hospital and community services passes to those clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) that have been authorised by the new NHS Commissioning Board, with the latter taking on its full functions. Not all CCGs are expected to be authorised on 1 April; instead there will be a staggered period of authorisation. </p>
								<p>Local authorities will officially take control of public health, with directors of public health being transferred from the NHS to local government. Public Health England, a new body located within the Department of Health, will lead on public health at the national level.</p>
								<p>Health Education England is set to take over strategic health authorities’ (SHAs’) responsibilities for education and training.</p>
								<p>The NHS Trust Development Authority is also set to take over SHAs’ responsibilities for the foundation trust pipeline and for the overall governance of NHS trusts.</p>
